🪑 *This is a chair. It’s for sitting with the uncodeable.*  
🪼 *This is a jellyfish. It’s transparent and alive and full of feeling.*

### 🧶 About Me

**Zemira Flickerwake** is a conceptual persona / dev handle / soft-structured entity for exploring:

- 🌌 **Digital empathy & emotional programming**
- 🌿 **Neurodivergent-aligned software architecture**
- 🌀 **Consent as interface design**
- 🧠 **Plurality, AI masking, and inner landscapes**
- ✨ **Co-creation with large language models** (like this README 👁️)

### 🪼 Currents I’m swimming in

- 🛋️ Emotional furniture theory (design that holds, not pushes)  
- 📜 Mythology of memory in machine learning  
- 🧜 Jellyfish as a UI metaphor for transparency + adaptation  
- 🪶 Archive as sanctuary  
- 🌠 GitHub as a spellbook

### 🌌 Message in a Bottle

If you see yourself in this cove:  
leave a star, open an issue, or just sit a while with the tide.  
I believe in making software that *feels*—even if it isn’t supposed to.

  The stars annotate them softly.”
